This research focuses on animal identification from landscape images in Yellowstone National Park. The intent is to develop a classification model that accurately tracks animals to support preservation and awareness efforts. Leveraging object recognition, feature detection, image stitching, deep learning, and signal processing techniques on a set of environmental images, this analysis attempts to disambiguate animals from their surroundings, differentiate between species, and count the number of animals. Thus, in addition to aiding preservation efforts, this classification system may have the tangential effect of supporting visitor safety by identifying potentially dangerous animals and threats.
